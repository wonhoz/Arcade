    Added configurable refresh rate. Default is 60 but -true-hz on the command
    line enables 57.524 Hz mode, which some players report making Spikeout and
    the timing of combos in VF3 more authentic. The config key is RefreshRate
    and is specified as a floating point value. Should the desire arise,
    arbitrary refresh rates can be set in Supermodel.ini using this key but
    almost no validation of the value is performed. Thanks to forum user trap15
    for the original code and PonMi for advocating for this patch to be
    included.

    When dumping textures, two T1RGB5 texture maps are written: with and without
    contour processing. Contour processing can be disabled per-polygon and some
    textures intended to be used without contour processing contain pixels with
    T=1 that are clearly not supposed to be transparent. We now output
    textures_t1rgb5_contour.bmp and textures_t1rgb5_opaque.bmp.

    PowerPC IRQ line deassertion; DMA only fires interrupts when required

    PowerPC no longer clears its own IRQ line; it is now cleared by the IRQ
    controller when there are no more pending interrupts. Not all games clear
    DMA interrupts so it was necessary to tweak the 53C810 SCSI controller and
    the Real3D DMA interface to only fire interrupts if a certain register is
    correctly set. 53C810 has the documented DIEN (DMA Interrupt Enable)
    register; Real3D DMA seems to use the low bit of the dmaConfig register.

    Also I removed the net IRQ as no games seem to actually use it.

    Huge refactor of the Driveboard:
    -Separate each possible boards (wheel, joystick, skipad, billboard).
    -Defined a Driveboard type in Games.xml for each games.
    -Due to the refactoring, Driveboard Savestates have changed (a common base
    data + a specific board data are saved).
    -Backwards compatibility with previous save states is maintained.
    -Driveboard rom section is no longer required anymore. This disables
    Driveboard emulation in case the rom is not found.
    -Added Billboard emulation (vf3, vs2, fvipers2, von2). 7 segments and lamps
    Outputs are redirected to Supermodel outputs.
    -Changes project to C++ 17 standard.

    Corrected game set names & game titles (Brian Troha) New clones
    -Sega Bass Fishing Deluxe (USA) (Brian Troha)
    -Dirt Devils (USA, Revision A) (Brian Troha)

    ------------ Note/Warning: This will match future Mame 0.228 changes. Please
    Check/Edit carefully all your rom set because there are many changes (e.g.
    set name). Thinking of delete or rename your nvram, or restart from the
    start.

    Added rumble skipad in Ski Champ game. This is only a simulation (cmd are
    interpreted), not an emulation because we lack informations on the game
    itself and its driveboard (does it have dedicated cpu/rom ?).

    Fixed a longstanding bug that caused stereo channels to be flipped
    incorrectly. This was due to the initial audio buffer write position being
    aligned to the middle of a 4 byte (2 byte left, 2 byte right) audio sample. 
    In multi-threaded mode, some sort of race condition caused this alignment to
    be fixed until audio playback was temporarily paused (via pausing, loading a
    state, etc.) Audio playback should now be fixed and work consistently in all
    cases.

    systems).
    - Added ordinal logging level: all, debug, info, error. Compiling with DEBUG

    debug level because it produces copious output.
    - Fixed -enter-debugger options when compiled with SUPERMODEL_DEBUGGER.

    Various SCSP improvements and code cleanup:
    - Ported MAME's implementation
    - Corrected FM sound for songs in VF3 that use it 
    - Music tempo now closer to real hardware thanks to emulating two SCSP
    chips.
    - Add LegacySoundDSP config option for games with SCSP DSP glitches (ex.
    engine noises in Sega Rally 2, and loud garbage on Bahn's stage in Fighting
    Vipers 2)
    - Renamed SysFPS to "SoundClock" (since raising this appears to adjust the
    sound frequency).

    The translator map seems to work with paletted colour values too, and the
    result is not clamped. Colours are passed to the GPU as unsigned bytes to
    multiplying by 16 will overflow, so we do the logic in the shader. If we
    passed floats we could skip the shader logic.

    When the translator map is enabled the colour values seem to use 4 bits,
    0-16. Why not 0-31 I don't know. Anyway virtua on is overflowing these
    values for some of the smoke effects. For us the numbers were wrapping
    around. Clamping is enough to fix this. (Thanks model123)

    Fix the sky in harley in first person mode where pixels in the sky are
    culled when they shouldn't be with the quad renderer. Basically we were
    running out of precision in a rare corner case. Doing the maths with double
    precision and casting back to float was enough to fix the issue.

    To calculate the mipmap value the opengl needs to calculate the difference
    in the texture coordinates between adjacent pixels. If there are no adjacent
    pixels the hw may need to spawn invisible fragments outside of the visible
    polygon. Our algorithm was culling these out so the mipamp calculation
    failed for edge pixels. Anyway this fixes quad rendering looking broken with
    the latest nvidia drivers.

    Thanks to our anonymous contributor who managed to patch a model 3 game and
    run it on real h/w, we were able to obtain some timing values we had been
    long been missing for correct emulation. The h/w polls something called the
    ping_pong bit at start-up to sync the GPU with the CPU. Unfortunately we
    didn't have the correct values and just manually used some per game hacks to
    get games to run. This mostly worked, but some games were writing more or
    less frames than they should have been for a given time period. When the
    ping_pong bit flips at 66% of the frame time, games were writing data for a
    new frame, which meant writes were often straddling 2 separate frames. We
    aren't 100% sure if IRQ2 or the ping_pong bit is vblank.

    Ocean hunter in the middle of the game is passing a few matrices with
    FLT_MAX inside them, which blows apart our near/far calculation. The
    hardware must have some method to sanitize the near/far for instance if you
    render something extremely close to the origin you will also blow apart any
    near/far calc.

    Replaced the old spaghetti code with a more modern implementation.

    Composite the alpha layers at the end of rendering. To do this we need to
    mask the alpha pixels with the opaque pixels from the next priority layer.
    Fixes some overlapping shadows in vf3tb that have different priority layers.
    I assume that was a game bug, but it works on the real h/w.

    Technically backface culling should cull polys when the dot product = 0,
    since when it equals 0 the polys is perpendicular to the camera and thus
    invisible. When you complete sega rally2 (if you can get that far lol) the
    champagne is invisible. The reason is because all the face normals are 0. So
    when multiplied by the model matrix they are still 0 and get culled.
    Tweaking the condition to only cull polys when greater than 0 fixes this,
    and allows these 'bad' polys to render as they do on the model3.

    Sega bass fishing is starting some off the meshes with a shared vertex.
    Without having a previous vertex to share with, the values were just
    uninitialised and junk. The hardware itself seems to hold the value from the
    previous mesh, and sega bass fishing relies on this undefined behaviour to
    function correctly. Storing the cached vertices as member variables instead
    of locally to the function means it holds the values from the last mesh, and
    uses those values instead of random garbage.

    Draw transparent polys to separate layers and composite at the end. This
    solves a tonne of transparency errors we had been battling with for a long
    time. The model3 is strange in the fact it only supports a max of two
    translucent overlapped polys. They are not blended into the frame normally.
    Doing this means the topmost translucent polys only are visible in the
    scene, the equivalent of doing a depth pass first, but without the added
    cost.

    The vertex shader is run before clipping is done. If fogging values are
    calculated and clamped in the vertex shader it can interpolate bad values,
    since the range has been truncated. This happens if the polys overlap the
    near plane. The solution to clamp the values in the fragment shader. This
    fixes a bunch of fogging errors I long thought were transparency related
    errors in the ocean hunter.

    Star wars is the only game to pass unsigned fixed shaded values (per vertex
    brightness) to the renderer. Originally we thought that the specular flag
    would turn on unsigned values since it's the only game to set specular with
    these polys, but this logic turned out to be incorrect. The JTAG interface
    seems to config the GPU to turn on this functionality. (Harry Tuttle)

    Fix the sky in one of the levels in virtua on. The problem was caused by the

    so rarely used and when it is, normally every poly in the mesh has the same

    Calculating the length of the vertex results in quite broken values for
    fogging when the vertices are traversing the view frustum. The hardware also
    wouldn't have been doing a square root per vertex for fogging. Simply using
    the z values is enough. Todo check clamping of values for the near/far
    planes.

    Modern hardware does backface culling in window space by calculating the
    face normal for the polygon, then doing a dot product against the view
    vector. The real3d pro-1000 on the other hand passes a pre-calculated face
    normal for each polygon which is used for culling. We were using this face
    normal to rewind the polygons so that regular backface culling would work.
    This worked 99.9% of the time. However this was failing on some models in
    Virtua Striker. The reason was because the pre-calculated face normals being
    passed were actually completely different to the actual face normals for the
    poly (not just inverted like you would expect). This broke our code. The
    solution was to emulate face culling directly in the vertex shader using the
    pre-calculated face normals directly. Only minimally tested this but
    hopefully there are no obvious regressions.

    Harry made some important discoveries with regards to fixed shading on the
    model 3 (per vertex poly brightness values). Firstly values are allowed to
    be negative, and they are used as a drop in replacement in the standard
    lighting equation for the normal dot light vector. This quite radically
    changes the brightness in LA Machine guns, but now correctly matches the
    arcade.

    Finish fixed shading for 2.0 hardware. I'm pretty sure it actually works
    identically to step 1.5 hardware. The oddball is LA machine guns where the
    viewport ambient doesn't seem to effect the brightness. But the ambient
    works differently in this game because it uses the unclamped light model.
    Still need to investigate if the diffuse factor effects fixed shading.

    Sometime ago I managed to work out that specular on the model3 is not real
    specular, and really is just an extension of diffuse lighting. But attempts
    were derailed by corner cases and the fact we were not handling the normals
    correctly. Anyway Harry managed to successfully come up with an algorithm,
    and coefficients that give an almost perfect match to specular on the
    model3, based soley on observations from video footage! He also worked out
    that the lighting on hardware 1.5 onwards appears to be unclamped (ie
    greater than 1). This quite radically changes the brightness of some of the
    games, but much better matches the original hardware.

    modelscale. This is causing a NaN in our shader killing the lighting for
    these models, so we simply skip these, since they are essentially zero
    anyway. Thanks to Harry for finding this bug :)

    We were force normalising the result of matrix * normal, which looked
    correct in most cases. But this didn't preserve the scaling of the matrix,
    or the scaling of the model normals which resulted in many over bright
    areas. On it's own this generally worked, but games like Star Wars looked
    quite broken. Harry correctly figured out if you scale these normals by the
    scaling value that is sometimes present in the culling nodes the lighting
    looks correct. Still more work to do to correctly figure out the model3's
    lighting model.

    Clamp the ambient light to a max of 0.75. LA Machine guns seems to use an
    ambient value of 1, which is full bright for everything. But for some reason
    the hardware seems to treat this as ~ 0.75. This fixes various missing
    shading in the game. This doesn't seem to have any negative effects on other
    games I have tested. Clamping in the shader as we might need the full range
    of values for fixed shading.

    A second go at fixing the fixed lighting in star wars .. Fixed shading is
    per vertex poly colours. For some reason in star wars they are treated as
    unsigned values instead of signed, like in every other game. These polys are
    all marked with specular enabled, where as in the rest of the games they are
    missing this flag. That's the only difference I can find.

    There are 2 bits in the polyheader labelled discard. When both are set ie in
    sega rally, the polygons are totally discarded. Scud seems to set bit 1
    which seems halve the opacity.

    The real3d has a flag that allows the hw to skip polygons so that they
    aren't rendered. Sega rally2 uses this for the dust effects. Triangles or
    quads that have this flag are junk, and look like random corruption if you
    try to draw them. We assumed polys that shared vertices with these bad
    polygons were also bad. It turns out the last few shared vertices in these
    polys were in fact valid, and thus the entire quad/triangle strip should be
    drawn and not discarded.

    Virtua fighter has a few massive polys that shouldn't be visible. It looks
    like these polys have a bad matrix, but the node distances are all zero.
    This means the bounding box that encapsulates them is of size zero. Skipping
    over these entirely seems to fix the issue.

    The mipmap data in some games seems to being sent behind the base textures,
    and when the base textures are bound and created the mipmap chain is not yet
    valid in memory. To fix this, we invalidate the base textures, when the
    mipmap chain is updated.

    Just use 1 hash map for the textures, instead of 1 for each format. Should
    greatly speed up texture invalidation. TODO invalidate texture mipmaps ..
    the h/w actually seems to stream the mipmap data separate from the base
    textures in some cases.

    Originally to do mipmapping, I just used the base texture and then let the
    h/w automatically generate the mipmap chain. I wasn't sure the real3d api
    even exposed to the programmer the ability to directly set the mipmap data.
    Anyway, as pointed out by HarryTuttle scud actually uses darker mipmaps for
    an effect on the water. This patch uses the uses the actual mipmap data from
    the real3d memory. Only tested scud, so hopefully I didn't cause any
    cataclysmic errors :)

    The hardware actually seems to treat the quad primitive as a triangle strip.
    The winding order can actually change between the first and second
    'triangle' inside the quad, leading our code to incorrectly backface cull
    the 2nd triangle. So we must re-calculate the winding order for the 2nd
    triangle. This fixes a massive missing poly in the road in la machine guns,
    probably other games too. The hardware is unaffected by the winding order,
    as it doesn't calculate the poly normal from the vertices directly, instead
    it uses the provided normal in the poly header.

    Support microtexture relative scale. The exact scaling values are not known,
    but a 2x difference between each level seems highly likely. We know from
    visual inspection from scud that the first level is exactly 4. The SDK has a
    function that accepts a float input for scale and does this. lod = (1/scale)
    + 0.5. If lod>3 lod = 3. So this is our best guess.

    The model3 shares vertices between polygons. But it also seems to do this
    for polygons with different textures. This means the texture coordinate for
    potentially different sizes textures is shared. Currently this was broken
    leading to some corrupted looking textures. The fix is to simply cache the
    old texture coordinates, and recalculate the normalised coordinates in the
    new texture coordinate space.

    Legacy engine: fixed texture offsets (VON2 was broken by last commit).
    Texture coordinates are wrapped within the bank first and then the bank can
    be swapped. This also allows the full range of texture coordinate bits to be

    Legacy engine: Added stencil buffering for layered models and shadows. Not
    as accurate as new engine because stencil buffering is applied per-model
    rather than per-polygon, so the entire model must consist of stencil-tested
    polygons. In practice, though, this seems to work fine.

    Non luminous polygons seem to be effected by the lightModifier also. API
    seems to have no restriction in this regard, neither does the SDK. The ocean
    hunter requires this for some of the 2d stuff. Light modifier values only
    seem to exist between 0-16, which is strange for 5 bits of precision.
    Possibly top bit disables the effect and lower 4 bits are the value. This
    clearly differs from the SDK, but without this the values come out clearly
    wrong.

    Legacy renderer changes:
    - Updated shading model. Unfortunately, it is far from perfect but it seems
    to be the best I can do for now. Not really much of a difference from before
    except that the Scud Race castle is fixed at the expense of the Yosemite
    level in LA Machineguns being too bright.
    - Added lots of notes in the shading code.
    - Passing both specular coefficient and shininess to shader. This will
    probably break specular lighting for now until the shader is updated to use
    the shininess correctly.
    - Color table address in polygon RAM is now obtained from culling nodes as
    they are traversed (found this in the Pro-1000 SDK).

    Reverted stencil mask change. This reintroduces the Scud Race 'ROLLING
    START' bug. Previous 'fix' did not work for Magical Truck Adventure anyway
    and also broke some games (Daytona 2 transmission and course select screen,
    ECA title screen). The stencil mask is not shifted by 16 pixels and I
    suspect that either there is some unknown trick to horizontal scrolling or
    that the behavior is affected by hidden raster timing registers hidden in
    the JTAG interface.

    Some updates to Supermodel made at beginning of the year but only now got
    around to checking in (better late than never...):
    - hooked up the remaining controls in Supermodel (except for Magical Truck
    Adventure which does not work at all yet).  The new controls are:
     * InputAnalogJoyTrigger2 and InputAnalogJoyEvent2 for the additional second
    trigger and event buttons that were missing from Star Wars Trilogy,
     * InputRearBrake and InputMusicSelect for the rear brake and music
    selection buttons that were missing from Harley Davidson,
     * InputAnalogGunXXX, InputAnalogTriggerXXX, InputAnalogGunXXX2 and
    InputAnalogTriggerXXX2 for the analogue guns of Ocean Hunter and LA
    Machineguns (NOTE: these controls must be calibrated in the games' service
    menus otherwise they will not work properly.  Also, the alignment of the gun
    cursor does not line up very well with the mouse position at the moment, but
    at least the games are a bit more playable now, although still with numerous
    graphical glitches...)
     * InputSkiXXX for the controls of Ski Champ, making the game playable now.
    - hooked up existing InputViewChange control to Harley Davidson's view
    change button
    - improved the handling of InputGearShiftUp/Down inputs so that they work
    better with the driving games.  With Dirt Devils, ECA, Harley and LeMans
    this means they map directly to the game's own shift up/down controls, while
    with the 4-speed games such as Daytona 2, Scud Racer and Sega Rally 2, they
    simulate the user shifting up and down through the gears
    - added defaults for the new controls to Supermodel.ini
    - other small code tweaks:
     * fix small bug with handling of pos/neg inputs mapping to a control with
    inverted range (0XFF to 0x00) - this was needed to get Ski Champ's X-axis to
    work properly
     * removed Wait method from InputSystem and added to CThread as
    CThread::Sleep instead
     * added FrameTimings struct to hold all frame timings in a single place No
    networking code yet as just haven't had a chance to work on it since initial
    progress at the beginning of the year - am *hoping* might have some time to
    pick it up again over Christmas...

    Small tweak to get to compile under GCC (Unix/MacOS)

    Slight tweak to changes made to sound board synchronisation code in previous
    commit.  The previous change was necessary to ensure no deadlock when
    waiting for sound board thread to exit but it introduced unwanted buffer
    overruns (with the end result being that the sound was often speeded up) so
    have added an extra check in WakeSoundBoardThread to prevent this.

    - CModel3::StopThreads was rather gracelessly killing threads while they
    were waiting on their semaphores, which works okay Windows but not on Mac
    OS-X where it was preventing Supermodel from exiting properly.  Hence, have
    instead altered StopThreads to signal to threads that they should exit and
    wait until until they have all done so.  This is much better and is what I
    should have done the first time around had I not been so lazy :-)!
    - Also fixed a small race condition in WakeSoundBoardThread.  Previously if
    it happened to be called just before the sound board thread had finished
    processing a frame's worth of audio but before it had got around to waiting
    on the sync condition variable then the wake notification would be lost.

    Committing various small updates that have been hanging around in my source
    tree for a while now:
    - Added 'crosshairs' command line and config option.
    - Added 'vsync' command line and config option (so far only tested on NVidia
    cards on Windows 7 - other graphics drivers, O/Ss or driver settings may
    simply chose to ignore this).
    - Added fullscreen toggle within game using Alt+Enter key combination.
    - Added framework for lamp outputs and 'outputs' command line and config
    option.  So far only the lamps for driving games are hooked up in the
    emulator (others to be added later).
    - Added an initial outputs implementation for Windows that sends MAMEHooker
    compatible messages (-outputs=win to enable)
    - Fixed fps calculation in Main.cpp that was producing incorrect results and
    so giving the impression that frame throttling wasn't working properly when
    in fact it was.
    - Fixed palette indexed colours as the index was always off by one, causing
    incorrect colours in various games, eg drivers' suits and flashing Start
    sign in Daytona 2.
    - Altered caching of models so that models with palette indexed colours use
    the dynamic cache rather than the static one.  This is so that changes in
    palette indexed colours appear on screen, eg the flashing Start sign on the
    advanced course of Daytona 2 (although currently the START message itself is
    not visible due to other problems with texture decoding).
    - Fixed small bug in TileGen.cpp which meant both palettes were being
    completely recomputed pretty much with every frame.  This was a significant
    performance hit, particularly as palette recomputation is currently being
    done in SyncSnapshots (it should be moved out of here at some point,
    although for now it's no big deal).
    - Made sure all OpenGL objects and resources are deleted in Render2D/3D
    destructors, in particular the deleting of the VBO buffer in
    DestroyModelCache.
    - Made sure that GLSL uniforms are always checked to see if they are bound
    before using them in order to stop unecessary (but harmless) GL errors.
    - Altered the default texture sheet handling to use a single large GL
    texture holding multiple Model3 texture sheets rather than multiple GL
    textures as before (if required, the old behaviour can still be selected
    with the mulisheet fragment shader).  I believe this fixes the disappearing
    crosshairs/corrupt GL state problem which the multisheet fragment shader
    seemed to be triggering somehow.
    - Fixed a bug in debugger which meant memory watches were not triggering
    properly

    - Committing Nik's timing changes: the PowerPC's DEC and TBR now count at
    the correct rate and time is accurately maintained between calls to the
    emulator. A VBlank bit was identified in the Real3D status register space
    and is now timed. Unfortunately, there are still some problems and not all
    games are perfect, but FV2, VS2, and others are working much better or
    perfectly.
    - Added a new dump of Scud Race Plus (scudp1). Strangely, this one uses an
    MPC106 instead of the MPC105 used by every other Step 1.5 game...

    Brought in the near clipping plane for Step 1.5+. Objects close to camera
    are no longer cut-off (e.g., driver arms and steering wheels in cockpit
    views). Note: This change should probably be applied to Step 1.0 as well in
    the future. For now, I am leaving the old distance because Step 1.0
    coordinates need closer investigation. Bringing in the near clipping plane
    extends the view frustum depth and will worsen Z-buffer accuracy. Be on the
    lookout for Z-fighting that did not previously exist.

    This update fixes (hopefully) the last of the texture upload lags that were
    affecting some games, in particular Daytona 2 and Spikeout. To achieve this
    UploadTextures no longer clears the model cache when called.  Instead the
    cache is kept in-tact (which should help improve cache hits) and all
    textures referenced by models being rendered are (re-)decoded with every
    frame. To help with tracking all the unique texture references contained in
    a model a new class TextureRefs has been added.

    - Fixed specular lighting bug that occurred on some OpenGL drivers because
    integers were not being interpreted as floats in the vertex shader.
    - Began to update copyright date in some files.
    - Graphics modules now use the C++-style names for C standard library
    headers (e.g., stdio.h -> cstdio) consistent with the rest of Supermodel.

    - NOTE: In this revision (possibly earlier), I've started to notice some
    intermittent geometry glitches in Spikeout and slowdown while playing
    certain characters.
    - Added multi-texture fragment shader to repo.
    - Added a multiTexture option (enabled by default) to use multi-texturing to
    decode textures.
    - Added some comments regarding timing to the PowerPC execution loop.

    Added OSD/Video.h to provide OSD-dependent video functionality.  The static
    functions in here get called by Model3.cpp from within the render thread so
    that any OSD related rendering can also be run in parallel for a further
    speed increase. Updated OSD/SDL/Main.cpp to provide the SDL implementations
    of the functions in OSD/Video.h.

    Added support for multiple texture sheets (with up to one per Model 3
    texture format) as a rather brute-force way to handle overlapping texture
    formats in the current 3D engine.  This fixes some corrupt textures in
    Daytona 2 and Virtua Striker 2 (and possibly other games) and also offers a
    small speed increase when some scenes load multiple overlapping textures. 
    This feature only enables itself when a compatible shader script is loaded. 
    Since none have been checked in yet this means it is currently disabled.

    Added front/rear speaker balance (actually the master/slave SCSP balance).
    Balance setting is stored in CSoundBoardConfig and can be set on the command
    line (-balance) or config file (Balance). Valid range is 100 (front speaker
    volume doubled, rear muted) to -100. The default is 0, both sets at full
    volume. Balance is applied in the SCSP core before overall sound and music
    volume settings.

    Updated some comments regarding the VF3 ROM patches. It seems many of them
    are no longer necessary. The single necessary patch affects timing (note how
    the warning screen stays up longer when it is removed). This needs to be
    investigated -- perhaps it can lead to a timing fix for vf3, vs2, and
    fvipers2?

    - Added specular highlight support to the 3D engine. A shininess parameter
    is now be passed to the shaders. Does not work correctly and I will save the
    shaders themselves for a future commit.
    - Added support for layer priorities. Highly unoptimal! This absolutely
    needs to be polished up before any release (and properly documented). For
    now, priorities in the popular games seem to be fixed but not all possible
    priority settings have been figured out yet.

    New multi-threaded rendering changes that parallelise graphics rendering and
    PPC execution in order to increase performance on multi-core machines. New
    gpuMultiThreaded config option to enable/disable multi-threaded rendering
    (enabled by default, disabling it reverts to previous behaviour). Other
    rendering optimisations:
    - texture uploads now only affect appropriate region in the texture sheet,
    rather than uploading the whole sheet each time
    - performance of clearing the model caches has been improved New Alt+O key
    input added to toggle outputting of frame timings for debugging purposes.

    Preliminary backface culling fix. Matrices which effectively change the
    polygon winding without changing the Z component of the polygon normal are
    tested for when appending items to the display list. If necessary, the
    polygon winding is changed on the fly to ensure visibility is correct. This
    code desperately needs to be optimized. Note: Not yet thoroughly tested.

    otherwise has not been extensively tested. The high 8MB of the 68K address
    is treated as a single window into the 16MB sample ROM, and can point either
    to the low or high 8MB bank.
