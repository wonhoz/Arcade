How to use
----------
All u need to do is run the trainer select the cheats of the game
u want to have cheats and then run zinc while the trainer program
is still running. The trainer will automaticly detect when zinc 1.1
is running and enable the cheats for the current game ure playing.

Pressing the minimize button will create a system tray icon in the lower
right part of your screen. A double left mouse click will show the trainer 
window again. You can as well right click the tray icon to show the popupmenu 
with options to show the window or to exit the trainer.

Note for frontend Authors.
--------------------------
You can incorporate this trainer in your frontend by changing the values 
in the trainer.ini file. As you can see my trainer saves everything under
the full game name. All you have to do is edit this ini file and start the 
trainer before you start a game. Afterwards you close it by sending WM_QUIT or
similar, just make sure that settings get saved in the ini and that you don't
write wrong values in it!!!

If u don't want to make 284 checkboxes u can just make an option to open the 
trainer and let the people select the cheat config's in the trainer itself.
Then u just have to run the trainer before u let zinc start and close it when
zinc's being closed. (the trainer will save all settings for u then).

You can as well make packages with this trainer included as long as you leave
this readme unchanged with it and give proper credits.


Cheat notes
-----------
Some games demonstration modes get affected by enabling cheats, for example
full life cheats or one hit kill cheats will affect them. This doesn't create 
problems, zinc will still be running fine when u play and it won't crash. (Had it
tested by letting zinc run demonstration sequences a whole night).

Star Gladiator US:  If u enable the always win cheat for both player1 and player2
				    Player1 will always win. The game behaves this way and enabling
				    both is unlogical!
Stage Select Codes: This code looks if the current stage is smaller then the stage
                    u want to start at. U can't change the stage select cheats while
                    zinc is running, because i came across problems with certain games
                    when this is done between rounds. (it's a safety).
