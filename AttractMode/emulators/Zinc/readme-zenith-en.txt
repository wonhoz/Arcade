 Installation
 ============

 1. Extract files from archive into ZiNc directory with overwrite
    "s11player.dll" file

 2. Place ROM file "pr1data.8k" in the root of your C:\ drive. This
    file contained in the current MAME sets for all of the System 11
    games (for example, Tekken). This file must not be in archive

 3. Execute ZeNith.exe


 Notice
 ======

 1. The games on Konami GV System hardware do not work together
    with Winterblast's input plug-in 1.6. So they are used
    default controller plug-in from ZiNc 1.1 distributive with
    the appropriate controls configuration

 2. Advanced video settings for P.E.Op.S. software renderer are
    stored in Windows registry. So it is necessary to remember
    what if you use this plug-in with others module based emulators
    Sony PlayStation (for example, ePSXe), changing settings by
    ZeNith also change they in the others emulators and vice versa

 3. If game is not running press Ctrl+F11, in this case in the
    root folder of emulator will appear file zenith.bat. After
    starting it you can see messages of ZiNc console and to
    determine the reason of the problem

 4. ZeNith distributive included the files of others developers:
    - ZiNc OpenGL and D3D renderers 1.2 from htp://emuhype.com
    - P.E.Op.S. Software renderer 1.17 from
                             https://sourceforge.net/projects/peops
    - Winterblast's input plug-in 1.6 from http://emulator-zone.com
    - System 11 Player version 03/03/06 from Official ZiNc Forum
